# Project 04: Weather Impact On Ride Duration

## Project Overview
Analyze data from **Zuber**, a new ride-sharing company in Chicago, to uncover passenger behavior and evaluate how weather impacts ride frequency. This project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and data visualization using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The goal is to identify trends, improve customer experience, and optimize operations.
