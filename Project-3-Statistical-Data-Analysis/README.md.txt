Project 01: Instacart Data Analysis

Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset using Python. It leverages popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to uncover insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. The analysis includes data cleaning, aggregation, time-series evaluation, and visualizations to support data-driven decision-making. Ideal for learning and demonstrating EDA techniques in a business context.

Dataset Access

Due to file size limitations, the dataset required for this analysis is hosted externally on Google Drive.

Instructions to Download and Set Up the Dataset:

1. [Click here to download the dataset from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mZ--ezkxjBE-0pGjKT-GLeorUL_QX6MI?usp=sharing)

2. Once downloaded, follow these simple steps to prepare your local environment:

Navigate to your local project-01-instacart directory.

Create a new folder named exactly datasets within this directory:

project-01-instacart/
├── notebook.ipynb
└── datasets/   (create this folder)

Place the downloaded dataset file clearly into this new datasets folder:

project-01-instacart/
├── notebook.ipynb
└── datasets/
    └── instacart_dataset.csv  (place dataset file here)

Running the Notebook

Open the notebook file (notebook.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook, ensure your dataset is placed correctly as described above, and execute the cells sequentially.
