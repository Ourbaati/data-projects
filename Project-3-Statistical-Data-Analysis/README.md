# Project 03: Video Game Sales Breakdown

## Project Overview
 This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset using Python. It leverages popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to uncover insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. The analysis includes data cleaning, aggregation, time-series evaluation, and visualizations to support data-driven decision-making. Ideal for learning and demonstrating EDA techniques in a business context.
