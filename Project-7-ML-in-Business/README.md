# Project 07: Regional Profit Margin Analysis

## Project Overview
**OilyGiant**, a mining company, aims to identify the most profitable region to develop a new oil well. This project uses exploratory data analysis and a linear regression model to predict oil reserves based on data from three regions. Key steps include:
Analyzing regional oil sample data

Training a linear regression model to predict oil volume

Selecting the top 200 most promising well sites out of 500

Estimating potential profit under a $100M budget

Evaluating financial risk and excluding high-risk regions (>2.5% chance of loss)

The final goal is to recommend the region with the highest expected profit while maintaining acceptable risk levels.
