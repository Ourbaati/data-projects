After thorough data preparation, including resampling, exploratory analysis, decomposition, and feature engineering, we trained and fine-tuned two machine learning models: Random Forest and LightGBM.\n",

    "Both models successfully met the project requirement of an RMSE under 48 on the test set. `The LightGBM model` outperformed with a lower **RMSE of 43.27** and faster prediction time **(0.07 seconds)**, making it the more suitable choice for deployment in a real-time prediction setting. `The Random Forest model`, while slightly less accurate **(RMSE: 44.51)**, also delivered reliable performance and robustness.\n",
